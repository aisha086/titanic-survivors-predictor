# About the Project
This was a fun practice project built to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like Sex, Passenger Class, Age, and Family Size.
I explored the dataset, trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest), and deployed the final model using Streamlit.
